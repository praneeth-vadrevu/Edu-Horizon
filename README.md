# EDU Horizon UID Project
## Overview

This project is a static HTML/CSS/JS site for managing courses, quizzes, and grades, inspired by Canvas LMS. Each course has its own page, and there are pages for creating and uploading quizzes, as well as entering grades.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**

   Download the project folder to your computer, or clone it using Git if available.

2. **Open the Dashboard**

   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (double-click or right-click and choose "Open with" → your browser).
   - All navigation between pages works via links—no server is required.

3. **Navigate the Site**

   - Click on a course card on the dashboard to view the course page.
   - Use the sidebar and buttons to access quizzes, grades, and other features.
   - To return to the dashboard, use the "Dashboard" link in the sidebar.

4. **No Installation Needed**

   - All functionality is client-side and works in any modern browser.
   - No additional software or setup is required.

## Notes

- The AI chat feature on the dashboard uses a third-party API and may not work if the API key is invalid or rate-limited.
- File upload and quiz creation features are placeholders and do not store data.
